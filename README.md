Project Description: Library Management System
This project is a comprehensive Library Management System developed in Python using SQLite for database management. The application allows users to perform various operations related to managing a library's book records. Key features include:

Adding New Book Records: Users can add new books to the library's database by entering details such as book name, code, author, and price.
Viewing All Book Records: Users can view a list of all the books in the library, displayed in a well-formatted table.
Searching for Books: The system allows users to search for books by their name, displaying relevant details if found.
Updating Book Records: Users can update existing book records, modifying details such as name, code, author, and price.
Deleting Book Records: The application provides functionality to delete specific book records by their serial number.
Deleting All Records: Users can clear all book records from the database with a single operation.
The project utilizes object-oriented programming principles and includes a user-friendly interface to facilitate easy interaction. It is ideal for library staff and administrators to manage and maintain book inventories efficiently.
